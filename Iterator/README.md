Iterator
========

Definition
----------

The iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers; in some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.

Scenario
--------

We want to implement the Fibonacci series of numbers using the PHP Iterator pattern: http://php.net/manual/en/class.iterator.php
